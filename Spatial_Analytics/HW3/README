The rmdformats files work but they don't knit with results. I tried to make it output results as well but it seemed to just break so I made another version where you
can also see my maps and results of the code (the plain name without rmdformats in it). They are otherwise the same only in htmls one has results.
Please choose whichever you prefer or whichever you find easier to get through.
