I have been trying to work on this for some time but for some reason I can't even load the IKONOS files 
KazEastfused.tif
I have been using brick, raster, stack etc but nothing works. Furthermore, I can't really figure out which data
am I supposed to use for what as there is so many and some seem redundant? 
So roses are marked as perrenial or cropland but then the researchers have been evading them so they are missing in the data????
I have so many questions..

Hopefully I manage to upload something if I can get my R to even read the file. 

Can't find the file KAZ_surveyarea anywhere in the data folder or Github
